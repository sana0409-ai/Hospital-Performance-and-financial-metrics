# Hospital-Performance-and-financial-metrics
This repository contains a Tableau project focused on analyzing the financial and operational performance of Olive General Hospital. The project examines the hospitalâ€™s challenges in 2022, when it faced significant financial losses, reduced patient admissions, and declining insurance coverage. Using Tableau as the primary visualization tool, along with Excel and CSV files for data preparation and PowerPoint for reporting and presentation, the analysis highlights how outpatient services were most affected, with admissions dropping nearly 50 percent from the previous year. The project further explores the relationship between reduced insurance coverage and increased out-of-pocket costs for patients, which led to delayed treatments and financial strain for both patients and the hospital. By combining hospital revenue, profit, admission trends, insurance coverage, and claim cost data, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the underlying issues and offers insights into possible solutions. These include policy adjustments by insurance companies, community donor support, and preventative care initiatives. The overall purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how data visualization, supported by modern analytics tools, can guide healthcare decision making and provide actionable insights to stabilize hospital finances while ensuring continued patient care.
